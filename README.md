In this project, we utilized Selenium to scrape live product data from eBay's Global Tech Deals section, focusing on details such as the product title, price, original price, shipping information, and product URL. The scraper was automated using GitHub Actions to run every three hours for two days. Afterward, we cleaned the raw data by removing unwanted characters, handling missing values, and calculating discount percentages. The cleaned dataset was then used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in google colab rather than Jupiter Notebook, where we examined product pricing trends, discount patterns, and shipping information.  The analysis revealed that popular keywords in product titles included brands like "Apple" and product types such as "Laptop" and "Tablet." Additionally, most products offered free shipping, and we identified the top 5 products with the highest discounts. Overall, this project highlighted the value of scraping e-commerce websites to analyze trends and deals, and it provided actionable insights into eBay's pricing and discount strategies.
One of the challenges i faced was with the pricing and original pricing were i found out i scraped the same price for both and all the discount prices were useless by then.
we can improve by :

scape the reviews to know peoples opinin on the product 
extend scraping time
