The model was validated via measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The accuracy was 99.95% which is an indicator of the overall correctness of the predictions; however, accuracy may provide a false sense of confidence when the data are imbalanced. The precision is 98.55% indicating that most of the frauds detected were actually fraudulent (which produces low false positives). The model's recall is 71.58%, which measures its ability to detect actual fraud cases and is a good score based on the amount of data imbalance. Finally, the F1 score indicates 82.93%, providing a measure of precision and recall while assuring that the model is not too sensitive in the detection of fraud.
